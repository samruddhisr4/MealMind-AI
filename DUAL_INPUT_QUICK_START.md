# Dual Input Image Analyzer - Quick Start Guide

## What is the Dual Input System?

The Visual Recognition feature now supports **two inputs working together**:

1. **Image Upload** - Upload your food photo
2. **AI Guidance Prompt** (Optional) - Describe the dish to help AI better understand it

## How to Use

### Step 1: Navigate to Image Analysis

- Click "Image Analysis" in the navbar
- Or go to the home page and click "Analyze Food Images"

### Step 2: Upload Your Food Image

- **Option A:** Drag and drop an image onto the upload area
- **Option B:** Click the upload area and select an image from your device
- Supported formats: JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP
- Max file size: 5MB

### Step 3: (Optional) Add AI Guidance Prompt

In the "AI Guidance Prompt" textarea, you can optionally provide context about your food. Examples:

#### For International Cuisine

### Step 4: Click "Analyze Food Image"

- Hover over badges to see full ingredient names

### Step 6: Next Actions

Choose what to do with the detected ingredients:

**Option A: Get Nutrition Details**

- See calories, protein, carbs, fats, fiber
- Get detailed nutritional breakdown

**Option B: Create a Meal Plan**

## Why Use the Prompt?

### Without Prompt

**Image:** Blurry photo of mixed food
**Result:** "rice, vegetables, sauce"
**Accuracy:** 40%

### With Prompt

**Image:** Same blurry photo
**Prompt:** "Indian butter chicken with rice and vegetables"
**Result:** "chicken, butter, onions, tomato, garam masala, rice, peas, carrots"
**Accuracy:** 85%

## Prompt Tips & Tricks

### ✅ Good Prompts

- "Thai red curry with chicken and basil"
- "Caesar salad with grilled chicken and croutons"
- "Spaghetti carbonara with bacon and parmesan"
- "Sushi rolls with salmon and avocado"
- "Vegetable soup with broth and herbs"

### ❌ Avoid These

- "Food" (too vague)
- "Asian stuff" (not specific)
- "Random dinner" (no context)
- "I don't know what this is" (unhelpful)
- Very long essays (keep it brief)

### 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Include cuisine type:** "Mexican" helps AI understand flavor profiles
2. **Mention cooking method:** "Grilled", "baked", "fried" matters
3. **List key ingredients:** "with salmon" or "has mushrooms"
4. **Note special diet:** "Vegan curry" or "gluten-free pasta"
5. **Keep it short:** Under 50 words is ideal

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Unclear Photo

**Problem:** Image is blurry or poorly lit
**Solution:** Add prompt like "chicken sandwich on whole wheat bread"

### Scenario 2: Mixed Dish

**Problem:** Multiple ingredients hard to identify visually
**Solution:** Add prompt like "mixed vegetable stir-fry with soy sauce"

### Scenario 3: Restaurant Meal

**Problem:** Plated dish hard to deconstruct
**Solution:** Add prompt like "grilled fish with asparagus and hollandaise sauce"

### Scenario 4: Leftovers

**Problem:** What's in this container?
**Solution:** Add prompt like "left-over pasta with marinara sauce and meatballs"

## Troubleshooting

| Problem                    | Solution                                                 |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Ingredients not detected" | Try uploading a clearer image, add a prompt with context |
| "Wrong ingredients"        | Add prompt to specify what's in the image                |
| "Missing ingredients"      | Try from different angle, provide prompt with all items  |
| "Weird results"            | Ensure image is actually food, add helpful prompt        |
| "File too large"           | Use a smaller image (under 5MB)                          |
| "Can't upload"             | Check file is JPG/PNG/GIF, not corrupted                 |

## Example Workflow

```
1. Take photo of your lunch: "Mixed grain bowl"
2. Upload the image
3. Add prompt: "Quinoa bowl with chickpeas, roasted vegetables, and tahini dressing"
4. Click "Analyze Food Image"
5. Wait for results
6. See detected: quinoa, chickpeas, bell peppers, zucchini, tahini
7. Click "Analyze Ingredients" for full nutrition
8. See calories, protein, fiber breakdown

```

## Remember

- **Prompt is optional** - You can use image alone if you prefer
- **Prompts improve accuracy** - They help AI understand context
- **No character limit** - But keep prompts focused and brief
- **Privacy** - Prompts and images are processed server-side only, never stored
- **Speed** - Analysis takes 2-5 seconds depending on internet

## Questions?

If you're getting unexpected results:

1. Try uploading a different angle of the food
2. Provide a descriptive prompt with cuisine type and key ingredients
3. Ensure good lighting in your food photo
4. Check that your image is actually a food photo
